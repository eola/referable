# Referrable

Referrable provides you with a generator that happily creates a multi-tenant referral
system for your app with rewards, in just two steps.

1.
```bash
rails g referrable user && rails db:migrate
```

2.
```ruby
ReferrableReward.create! reward: 'A new car',
                         referrals_required: 10,
                         acquireable_by: 'user'
```

aaand... you're done!

```ruby
user = User.first

user.recruits
#=> #<ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy [...]>

user.recruits << User.create(name: 'Dan')
#=> #<ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy [...]>

user.referrals.count
#=> 1

user.distance_to_next_prize
#=> 9

user.percent_to_next_prize
#=> 10.0

user.last_acquired_prize.name
#=> 'nothing'
```

## Installation
